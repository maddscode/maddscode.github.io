	<p> --- friday september 23, 2022 ------------------------------------- <br>
	this week, i really learned how complicated coding is. using terminal really makes me feel like "real coder"! i want to know how to type lines and lines of code and be able to build whatever i need online from scratch.</p>

	<p> --- sunday october 2, 2022 ----------------------------------------<br>
	over the weekend, i spent a lot of time on the unser interface of my website and trying to get it looking as "boho" and aesthetic as possible. i am still having trouble figuring out how to change the color of the back of my person card and how to get it to flip. i also really want to know how to make divs into links and for some reason my github and my links are not working. hopefully i can figugre out the problem soon because visually the website is really coming together how i envisoned it to be.</p>

	now that molly helped me fix my person card and taught me how to make a div a link, i want to sort of similate what this girl ciara did with her portfolio because i love her aesthetic and i loved how she made cute menu drop bars.
