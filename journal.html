	<p> --- friday september 23, 2022 ------------------------------------- <br>
	 this week, we learned how to code using the terminal. back-end coding is
	really cool and i would love to learn more about different back-end languages.</p>

	<p> --- sunday october 2, 2022 ----------------------------------------<br>
	over the weekend, i spent a lot of time on the user interface of my website and trying to get it looking as "boho" and pretty as possible. i am still having trouble figuring out how to change the color of the back of my person card and how to get it to flip. i also really want to know how to make divs into links and for some reason my github and my links <br>
	are not working. hopefully i can figugre out the problem soon because <br>
	visually the website is really coming together how i envisoned it to be.</p>

	<p> --- tuesday october 3, 2022 ---------------------------------------- <br>
	now that molly helped me fix my person card and taught me how to make <br>
	a div a link, i want to sort of similate what this girl ciara did with her <br>portfolio because i love her aesthetic and i loved how she made cute <br>
	menu drop bars.

	<p> --- tuesday october 25, 2022 --------------------------------------- <br>
	couple classes ago, we were taught how to make an animation and molly wanted us to put our animation on our website. however, i thought that an animation wouldn't necessarily match the themes so i decided that my first project would be another website with scattered planets from our solar system plus some random planets. my animation might be a shooting star, but so far i still need to make a rocket follow my cursor so when you cick on a planet it looks like you're landing on a planet.
