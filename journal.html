	 this week, we learned how to code using the terminal. back-end coding is
	really cool and i would love to learn more about different back-end languages.

	<p>sunday october 2, 2022<br></p>
	over the weekend, i spent a lot of time on the user interface of my website to make it looke like a living room wall. i am still having trouble figuring out how to change the color of the back of my person card and how to get it to flip. i also really want to know how to make divs into links and for some reason my github and my links are not working. hopefully i can figugre out the problem soon because visually the website is really coming together how i envisoned it to be.

	<p> tuesday october 3, 2022<br></p>
	now that molly helped me fix my person card and taught me how to make a div a link, i want to add menu drop bars.

	<p>tuesday october 25, 2022<br></p>
	couple classes ago, we were taught how to make an animation and molly wanted us to put our animation on our website. however, i thought that an animation wouldn't necessarily match the themes of my website so i decided that my first project would be another website with scattered planets from our solar system plus some random planets. my animation might be a shooting star, but so far i still need to make a rocket follow my cursor so when you click on a planet it looks like you're landing on a planet.

	i have a lot of unfinished projects right now. here's a list of my projects:<br>
		(i moved to top since it will keep updating)

	<p>tuesday january 17, 2023<br></p>
	its has been a while since i made a journal entry, and in that time i changed my homepage, added links to my projects, and made a projects staus board. i still have to add music to my photoquilt and make my about me, but i am going to make my about me today.

	<p>tuesday january 31, 2023<br></p>
	so i have not made my about me nor added music to my photoquilt. that is what i neeed to work as well as finishing my flash cards. however, we're supposed to work on our iphone project which i already finished. but here is the steps i did:<br>
	1. create html and a div class for each repeated button <br>
	2. create a function that makes the divs and assigns pictures

	<p>friday april 14, 2023<br></p>
	i have just made a presentation to help me study for the l'hypothese test in french on 4/19
