	 this week, we learned how to code using the terminal. back-end coding is
	really cool and i would love to learn more about different back-end languages.</p>

	<p>sunday october 2, 2022<br>
	over the weekend, i spent a lot of time on the user interface of my website to make it looke like a living room wall. i am still having trouble figuring out how to change the color of the back of my person card and how to get it to flip. i also really want to know how to make divs into links and for some reason my github and my links are not working. hopefully i can figugre out the problem soon because visually the website is really coming together how i envisoned it to be.</p>

	now that molly helped me fix my person card and taught me how to make a div a link, i want to add menu drop bars.

	couple classes ago, we were taught how to make an animation and molly wanted us to put our animation on our website. however, i thought that an animation wouldn't necessarily match the themes of my website so i decided that my first project would be another website with scattered planets from our solar system plus some random planets. my animation might be a shooting star, but so far i still need to make a rocket follow my cursor so when you click on a planet it looks like you're landing on a planet.
