				/ˈfəNG(k)SHən/<br><br>

				If we call a function, it executes, returns a value, and then resumes the program where it was called. In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task is called a function. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine.

			<td>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements: <br>
			Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
			Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
			Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
			Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</td>
